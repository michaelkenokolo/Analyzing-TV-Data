# Analyzing-TV-Data
__This project analyzes historical data of Superbowl halftime shows and looks into multiple aspects of the game in terms of:__
- What are the most extreme outcomes?
- How does the game affect television viewership?
- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad costs evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The datasets used for this project were scraped and polished from Wikipedia and include 3 CSV files of all 52 Super Bowls until 2018:
- game data
